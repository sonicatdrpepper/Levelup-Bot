# LevelUp-Bot
A basic level tracking discord bot written in Python
This bot was designed with one specific guild in mind, and as such will probably have some issues out of the box in other guilds ;)
This is my first ever serious project, so please excuse all the poor quality code ;)

This project currently requires the installation of the following python modules
 * importlib_metadata
 * discord.py
 * discord.ext.context
 * numpy

 To run it, set the TOKEN variable in Main.py to your bot accounts token, and then run Main.py
