# LevelUp-Bot
A basic XP Discord bot written in Python
This bot was designed with one specific guild in mind, and as such will probably have some issues out of the box in other guilds. Setting AssignRoles to false in Config.ini should fix this.
This is my first ever serious project, so please excuse all the poor quality code ;)

This project currently requires the installation of the following python modules
 * importlib_metadata
 * py-cord
 * discord.ext.context

 To use the bot set the TOKEN variable in Main.py, and then run Main.py
